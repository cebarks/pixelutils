# pixelutils
A collection of random things I think could be useful for those using the [Pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) library.

## Available Tools
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/dusk125/pixelutils/wiki) to see how to use these tools.
* Sprite Packer:
    Runtime packer based on [rectpack2D](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D).
* ID Generator:
    Thread safe integer ID generator.
* Ticker:
    My attempt for an easy-to-use framerate limiter.
* Sprite Loader:
    A simple sprite/picture data loader based on the Pixel example.

## Planned
* [Voronoi Diagrams](https://github.com/pzsz/voronoi)
* [AStar Pathfinding](https://github.com/fzipp/astar)

## Contribution
Feel free to add any tools that you've created for Pixel, I just ask that they're documented well and an usage wiki entry is added.
