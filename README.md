# pixelutils
A collection of random things I think could be useful for those using the [Pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) library.

## Available Tools
* Sprite Packer:
    Runtime packer based on [rectpack2D](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D).
* ID generator:
    Thread safe integer ID generator.
* Ticker:
    My attempt for an easy-to-use framerate limiter.

## Planned
* [Voronoi Diagrams](https://github.com/pzsz/voronoi)
* [AStar Pathfinding](https://github.com/fzipp/astar)
